Prior to making any changes the webpage when launched experienced issues. Some of those issues are listed below.

The first link at the top of the page was not working. To fix this is did the following.
Changed the selector in the tag from id to class in order for this to work.

Some other changes that were made to this HTML file were the code was a little messy, such as the unordered list so i was able to clean this up to make it look nicer.

I changed the title from the generic "webpage" title to reflect the title of the website "Horiseon."

I also removed the div tag with a class of header and footer and replaced it with a footer and header tag instead.

Added some alt attributes to all images to ensure that it follows proper HTML format.

In the CSS file, i combined similar classes & id that have the same attributes to make things a bit cleaner and easier to read.

The website now seems to funstion better and all the code is much cleaner then it was before.
